/* The "copy code" link on exhibit pages. Left alone it's a plain link
   to the exhibit's standalone snippet (code.html, sitting next to the
   exhibit); with JS it becomes a copy button: fetch the snippet, put
   its full source on the clipboard, and say "copied" for a moment.

   Any failure falls through to the link's normal job — navigating to
   the snippet. That covers every environment the fetch-and-copy path
   can't: file:// (fetch refuses cross-file reads), browsers without
   the async clipboard, a denied clipboard permission. The visitor
   still gets the code, just one view-source away. */
